# University Projects

This repository shows some of the projects I have worked on throughout my university journey. Below is an overview of the featured projects:


## Projects

### **1. Lung Cancer Prediction - Decision Tree Model**
A machine learning project that applies a Decision Tree Classifier to predict the likelihood of lung cancer based on health and lifestyle factors. The project includes:
- **Dataset Exploration**: Cleaned and prepared a dataset of 309 records with 16 features.
- **Data Analysis & Visualization**: Used heatmaps and statistical summaries to explore feature correlations.
- **Model Implementation**: Split the dataset into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets, achieving predictive insights using Python libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.

### **2. Shipping Cost Calculator**
An object-oriented Java program developed during my first semester to calculate the optimal shipping cost for transporting products:
- **Features**: Calculates the best shipping method based on weight and volume constraints, supporting two container sizes.
- **Design Principles**: Follows object-oriented principles like inheritance and abstraction to structure the program.
- **Bonus Feature**: Includes a simple GUI for ease of use.

### **3. Weather App and Responsive Landing Page**
A comprehensive project combining a Flutter-based mobile app and a responsive web page:
- **Weather App**:
  - Displays current weather conditions, city name, and forecasts using the OpenWeatherMap API.
  - Features include navigation between multiple pages and a custom app icon.
- **Responsive Landing Page**:
  - Built with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.
  - Displays dynamic weather visuals, includes a contact form, and supports both Celsius and Fahrenheit units.

### **4. Age and Gender Detection**
A machine learning model designed to detect gender and approximate age from photos:
- Utilizes an existing dataset to train the model.
- Includes tools for analyzing and predicting from input images.
- The project is implemented using Python-based libraries.
