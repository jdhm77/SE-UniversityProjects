Shipping Cost Calculator

This project was my first university assignment during my first university semester for the Backend Programming course. The goal was to develop a Java based object-oriented solution to calculate the optimal shipping cost for transporting products.

Project Overview:
The program calculates the best shipping option based on volume and weight constraints. It supports two container sizes: small (6.06m length) and big (12.01m length). The implementation follows object-oriented programming principles, including inheritance and abstraction, to structure items, containers, and calculations. The project adheres to university guidelines for encapsulation, package structure, and method organization.

Features: 
The program allows users to enter order details, specifying the number of each product type. It then determines the most shipping method by considering container capacities and pricing rules. The implementation uses lists or arrays to manage items offered and orders, ensuring flexibility in handling different shipments. The output provides a description of the order and shipping costs final calculation stating the number and type of containers needed.

Extra-points
An optional simple GUI  was included for additional points.
