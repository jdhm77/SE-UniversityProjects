# Lung Cancer Prediction - Decision Tree Model

This project applies a **Decision Tree Classifier** to analyze a **survey dataset on lung cancer**. The dataset contains responses to various health and lifestyle factors, helping to predict the likelihood of lung cancer. The model was implemented in **Jupyter Notebook** using **Python** and libraries such as `pandas`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib`.

## Project Overview

1. **Dataset Exploration**  
   - The dataset consists of **309 records** and **16 features** (e.g., age, smoking habits, coughing, chest pain, etc.).  
   - Checked for missing values and ensured data quality.  
   - Categorical values (e.g., gender) were converted into numerical representations.  

2. **Data Analysis & Visualization**  
   - Generated a **heatmap** to examine feature correlations.  
   - Explored statistical summaries and distributions of the dataset.  

3. **Decision Tree Model Implementation**  
   - The dataset was split into **training (70%) and testing (30%)** sets.
